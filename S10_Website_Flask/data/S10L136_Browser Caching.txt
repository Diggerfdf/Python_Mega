Note on Browser Caching
Section 10, Lecture 136

Note: In the next lecture we're going to add CSS styling to the webpage.
Sometimes, when you make a change to the CSS file and then reload the webpage,
the changes are not shown because the browser uses the previous cached styling.
If that happens then please open the browser in private (incognito) mode and load the webpage there.
